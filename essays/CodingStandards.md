## Coding Guidelines 
A seasoned programmer knows how important it is to have their code meet the given coding standard. Coding standards are important when you begin to work in a group and every person has their style of programming. The coding standard can maintain a consistent flow in the code for everyone to understand. Some examples of coding standards given by geeksforgeeks go as follows, limited use of globals, standard headers for different modules, naming conventions for local variables, well documented, etc. Using coding standards can improve the development time and decrease the number of bugs in the code. Beginner programmers first learn about the importance of comments in code, then it develops into other areas of coding styles.

## Learning from the start 
The first programming class I took used jGrasp as our development environment to program in java. We used the checkstyle tool to determine if our code followed the set formatting rules our teacher set up. For each assignment, we had to make sure our code passed the checkstyle before turning it in. Sometimes we were lucky to have only a few errors, however, there would be times where we had a lot of checkstyle errors and it would take a long time to fix them. Implementing ESLint coding standards is a major game-changer for me when it comes to programming. I like how the green checkmark consistently updates as I type so if there an error would occur, I would be able to fix it on the spot. I'm excited to use the coding standards when working in a group because I feel like it will make coding as a team a lot easier instead of reading different styles of coding. 
 
## Passing the Knowledge On  
 When I am asked to judge the VEX IQ events for elementary- middle school, I am in charge of asking the students about their code to see if they are the ones who wrote the code or if an adult wrote it for them. Our main goal as judges is to see if the team is student lead or is it parent/teacher-led. As I look over their code I am looking for two important details in their code. One is that they can explain to me what their code does and if I wanted to change something specific, wherein the code would they make that change. The other thing I look at is how well they comment their code. Having comments in their code is great since their teammates can know what the code does and if they need to fix something, they know exactly where to look. It is also good for the judges who do not understand the programming language, they can look at the comments and get an understanding of what the student's program does in competition. With the knowledge I gained over the past weeks, I hope to share the coding guidelines with the students at the next competition.
