## Ethics is All Around Us
We use ethics in our everyday life and we probably do not think twice about it. On a community level, ethics is all about having a lot of people living together in harmony. On a personal level, it's about looking at yourself and figuring out what type of person you'd want to be. On a business level, it's about standards and rule you must follow to be professional. 

## Code of Ethics 
Engineers and Computer Sciencetist are some job fields where their ethics are very important to everyone in the world. Ethics has been in engineering since the early 1900s but why do these standards apply to us? Software Engineers can directly deploy their code to the user and not all programs would go through an ethical review. However for Civil Engineer, their projects go through a lot of reviews before they actually get to working on their projects. Since computer sciencetist have access to everyones digital life on the internet, they would have to follow a lot of ethics code since one wrong move could potentially cause harm in a persons life.
