## Ethics is All Around Us
We use ethics in our everyday life and we probably do not think twice about it. On a community level, ethics is all about having a lot of people living together in harmony. On a personal level, it's about looking at yourself and figuring out what type of person you'd want to be. On a business level, it's about standards and rules you must follow to be professional. 

## Code of Ethics 
Engineers and Computer Scientist are some job fields where their ethics are very important to everyone in the world. Ethics has been in engineering since the early 1900s but why do these standards apply to us? Software Engineers can directly deploy their code to the user and not all programs would go through an ethical review. However, for Civil Engineer, their projects go through a lot of reviews before they get to work on their projects. Since computer scientists have access to everyone's digital life on the internet, they would have to follow a lot of ethics code since one wrong move could potentially cause harm in a person's life. 

## Privacy Protection 
In the case study Errand Whiz, Karen is a young Lawyer who uses an app called Errand Whiz that merges information from her everyday life and helps her generate an efficient errand list. The app and Facebook have a deal where Facebook can sell the data to a third-party advertiser to target ads to the user's friends. Since the app has access to where she lives, shops, and works, this puts Karen's life in harm's way. If the data were to fall into the wrong hands, her personal information could be leaked to people who have vengeance against her since she works at a prestigious law firm. Karen's life is no longer private due to the app wanted to expand its clients. 

## My Views on Privacy Ethics
I believe that as software engineers we have an ethical and moral obligation to keep the user's data collection within the company and not sell it to third-parties. We should develop alternate ways to advertise the product without putting the existing user's information at risk. As a frequent social media user, I think about my privacy within the app and it truly makes me wonder what personal information about myself is out in the digital universe.
