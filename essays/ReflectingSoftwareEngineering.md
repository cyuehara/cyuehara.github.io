At the beginning of the semester, I was very nervous to be taking a Software Engineering class. I had no idea what I was walking into since I've heard mixed reviews of the class. The one thing I was excited about doing in this class was developing a website. Since my newest project for my job is to re-design a website, I knew that I would be able to use what I learned in this class for my work. I've learned so much over the semester but the two topics that stood out to me the most were:

## Coding Standards
Coding standards are important when you begin to work in a group and every person has their style of programming. The coding standard can maintain a consistent flow in the code for everyone to understand. Throughout the semester, I worked along side a panel of judges for the VEX robotics competitions to look over the students programming process. After learning about coding standards and how important it is in programming, I made it a point to pass on the knowledge I was learning to the younger students. The concept of coding standards came in handy when I was working on my final project with a group of students. We all have different styles of coding, however, making sure we implemented the coding standards as we developed our website was very helpful when we ran into problems.
