Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that causes respiratory illness similar to the flu. In December 2019 the Coronavirus emerged in the city of Wuhan, China, this diseases has spread world wide and all 50 states have reported COVID-19 cases. March 2020 the state has implemented a mandatory quarantine and social distancing to slow down this pandemic. Schools have been moved to online for the rest of the semester, only esential workers are to remain working and others have the opportunity to work from home. 

## You don't gotta go to work 
Three weeks into quarantine my daily routine has changed immensely. I no longer have to wake up 2 hours before my class and sit in 30 plus minutes of traffic to get to school. Since I requested to work from home during this time, I am able to do my office work in the comfort of my own home. One day of staying up late to study and not having to wake up early the next day to go to school/work has messed up my sleep schedule. Now I stayed up until 5am and wake up 3:30pm the same day. Thankfully my classes do not require me to login during regular class hours, therefore I am able to do my work at my own time. If we had to go back to school next week I don't think I would be able to fix my sleep schedule in time. 

## But you gotta put in work


## Gotta Work from home
