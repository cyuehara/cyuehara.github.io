Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that causes respiratory illness similar to the flu. In December 2019 the Coronavirus emerged in the city of Wuhan, China, this diseases has spread world wide and all 50 states have reported COVID-19 cases. March 2020 the state has implemented a mandatory quarantine and social distancing to slow down this pandemic. Schools have been moved to online for the rest of the semester, only esential workers are to remain working and others have the opportunity to work from home. 

## You don't gotta go to work.... 
Three weeks into quarantine my daily routine has changed immensely. I no longer have to wake up 2 hours before my class and sit in 30 plus minutes of traffic to get to school. Since I requested to work from home during this time, I am able to do my office work in the comfort of my own home. One day of staying up late to study and not having to wake up early the next day to go to school/work has messed up my sleep schedule. Now I stayed up until 5am and wake up 3:30pm the same day. Thankfully my classes do not require me to login during regular class hours, therefore I am able to do my work at my own time. If we had to go back to school next week I don't think I would be able to fix my sleep schedule in time. 

## But you gotta put in work....
In the past I only took one online classes along with regular in-person classes and I did not find it a problem with the course work. In order to be successful in passing online class is to have a strict study method. However, being stuck in my house everyday it is hard to focus on studying since all I want to do is sleep. This is my first semster as a full-time Manoa student so I can not afford to fail classes since my GPA is starting at zero. Before all our classes were moved to online, only ICS 314 has required "online" work during the week so it was easy to keep up with the course work. With all my classes moved to online I feel like my eyes have been glued to the computer screen 24/7. Along with taking the "hardest class" also known as ICS 311 Algorithms, I was debating if I wanted to drop that class since that class take a lot of time learning the contents and my study habits are slacking due to the change in our schedule.
