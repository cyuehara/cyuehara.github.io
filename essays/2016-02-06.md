## JAVA? NO! THIS IS JAVASCRIPT!

The first programming language I learned was Java. Understanding the coding for Java made learning C and C++ much easier for me. While doing a Google deep dive in programming lanuages, I noticed a lot of programmers had mixed opinions about Javascript. Around the time I was learning Java, the robotics team I mentor started to use Javascript to program their robot. This was the first time I experienced Javascript being used for something other than web development. Since I spent one semester not writing code, I was nervous to get back into the groove of learning a new program. Thankfully coding exercises in freeCodeCamp was able to get me started on learning the basics of Javascript. 

## Gym Day for the Brain 
My first experience with athletic software engineering was a rollercoaster of emotions. I am not the best when it comes to timed projects especially when I am not confindent in the material. Going into our first WOD, I had anxiety because I wanted to meet the average time it took to solve the problem. The practice WODs helped prepare me with different programming techniques to solve the given problem. I hope as the semester goes on that I will be more confident going in to complete the WOD. I know that doing these timed problem solving activities will help me prepare for job interviews in the future.
