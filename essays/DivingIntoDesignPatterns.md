As adults, we implement a strategic pattern into our everyday life to help us get through our day. We design this pattern from trial and error and we always work to improve it. Design patterns help software developers with general problems other programmers faced during deployment. Over time, the design pattern will evolve as the developers face new problems, and when new solutions are discovered. 

## Implementation of Design Pattern 
In my introduction to computer science courses at Kapiolani Community College, my professor assigned us projects that dealt with creational (class instantiation), structural (class and object composition), and behavioral (class object communication) design patterns. One of our assignments in ICS 211 we had to complete an object-oriented pokemon hierarchy for specific Pokemon species families. We were given a "blueprint" of how our program should be implemented and how each class is extended and implemented. This was very helpful to understand object-oriented programming as a beginner programmer. 

## Improvise. Adapt. Overcome
At Kapiolani Community College I was an ICS peer mentor for a year and one of the requirements we had to follow was a list of questions to ask before helping the student. The list of questions designed to make the most effective route when assisting the student and not waste time. This set up may have its flaws but since it was the first time they were implementing this design strategy, hopefully, it'll improve over time. When learning about design patterns for programming, I did not think about how I use them outside of the programming world. Once I made the connection, I was able to have a better understanding of different design patterns.
