## Project: Special Agents 
## Overview 
The problem: Students, faculty, and staff at the University of Hawaii at Manoa are able to participate in Intramural Sport activities during the school year. 

The solution: Students, faculty, and staff 

## The Approach 
Instead of placing people in the free agent category, there should be a way for the player to give a bit of information that lists:  
* Brief introduction 
* Sports experience  
* Availability 
* Competitiveness
* Contact information for followup

Players who visits the site can create a profile and it would be listed under players wanted, teams who are looking to fill up their rosters are able to look at the profiles and choose the players that would best compliment the team. 

Some mockup pages include: 
* Landing page 
* Player homepage (creating profile)
* Team homepage (all teams) 
* Special Agents page 
* Active Sports (list of sports active during semester) 
* Admin Homepage 

## Use Case Ideas 
* User creates an account, log-in, fill out information for their profile 
* Other users can look under special agents page to see profiles, team homepage to look at all the team 
* User goes to active sport, list sports during given semester, click sport category (volleyball), list players that are special agents, contact them 
* Admin goes to landing page, log in, gets team homepage and active sports, edits site 

## Beyond The Basics 
After implementing the basic functionality, here are some ideas for more advanced features: 
* Restrict Login/ Must be UH email 
* Indicator on team profiles to show which teams are looking for players 
* Message Interface to player profile 
* Notification that someone wants to add you to the team 
* Notification to team captain that player has been added to their respective sport category
