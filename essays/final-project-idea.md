## Project: Special Agents 
### Created by: Christine Uehara and Lucy Rock 
## Overview 
**The problem**: Currently UH Manoa has Intramural sport competitions, for games like soccer and volleyball, that students, faculty and staff can participate in. UH Manoa is currently using IMleagues.com for the sporting events and students are able to find people interested in joining teams. The problem with using this website is that it does not require a person to put in their history with the sport. For instance, if a person has played years of volleyball in high-school or as an extracurricular activity, then a team captain might want to recruit them over someone who has never played before. IMleauges places people wanting to join a team into a section called “Free Agents,” and only lists the names of these people. While a person can add additional information, it does not require them to put anything down. This leaves a team with no information to properly recruit more team members for what they need. In the end, teams end up not relying on this website to recruit. They try to get people to join by word of mouth, or recruiting people they know personally.  

**The solution**: The solution for this would be creating a website that UH Manoa students, faculty, and staff can use to show off their strengths in sports.  Instead of having "free agents" they would be considered "special agents."  As a special agent they can create a profile with a bio and history to help them get recruited for the teams they would like to join. They can give those who are recruiting an idea of what they would like to get out of playing as well. If a person wants to play for fun, or if they are focused more on trying to win. This information would be required on their profile, there would be text fields that makes them input more information. This would make a more inclusive and goal orientated team, as members can choose people that they know would work well with their team and what they want to accomplish.

## The Approach 
Instead of placing people in the free agent category, there should be a way for the player to give a bit of information that lists:  
* Brief introduction 
* Sports experience  
* Availability 
* Competitiveness
* Contact information for followup

Players who visits the site can create a profile and it would be listed under players wanted, teams who are looking to fill up their rosters are able to look at the profiles and choose the players that would best compliment the team. 

Some mockup pages include: 
* Landing page 
* Player homepage (creating profile)
* Team homepage (all teams) 
* Special Agents page 
* Active Sports (list of sports active during semester) 
* Admin Homepage 

## Use Case Ideas 
* User creates an account, log-in, fill out information for their profile 
* Other users can look under special agents page to see profiles, team homepage to look at all the team 
* User goes to active sport, list sports during given semester, click sport category (volleyball), list players that are special agents, contact them 
* Admin goes to landing page, log in, gets team homepage and active sports, edits site 

## Beyond The Basics 
After implementing the basic functionality, here are some ideas for more advanced features: 
* Restrict Login/ Must be UH email 
* Indicator on team profiles to show which teams are looking for players 
* Message Interface to player profile 
* Notification that someone wants to add you to the team 
* Notification to team captain that player has been added to their respective sport category
