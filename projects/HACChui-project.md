summary: Creating a website to provide a user friendly application to simplify and improve the team formation process during the Hawaii Annual Code Challenge
---
<h2> Hawaii Annual Code Challenge </h2>
[Hawaii Annual Code Challenge](https://hacc.hawaii.gov/) (HACC) is a unique hackathon that stregthens the pipeline of the IT workforce in the state of Hawaii. At the HACC kick off, participants form teams, select a challege that interests them and work together to create an innovative web application. In the past, the informal team formations lead to high failure rates with participants joining the wrong teams and their skills would go to waist. The students taking ICS 414 (Software Engineering II) spent eight weeks building a Meteor application intergrated with Slack to create [HACC Hui] (https://hacc-hui.github.io/) a user friendly web application to improve the team formation process at the event.
