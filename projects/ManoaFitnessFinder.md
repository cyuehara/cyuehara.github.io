<h2> Freshman Fifteen </h2>

 The term "Freshman 15" is an expression commonly used in the college community that refers to an amount of weight gained during a student's first year at college. Students who are affected by the freshman 15 might feel insecure to go to the gym alone and thus gain more weight throughout college. The website my team developed allows students to create a profile with thier fitness intrest/goals, meet new people, and create or attend events. The users are able to see their friends upcoming events and they can click a button to list that they are going to attend the event too. 
 
 <h2> My Role on the Team </h2>
 
 My role on the team was one of three web designers for the various pages we were going to have on our site. After our first meeting we decided which page mockups we wanted to design and have it ready for our second meeting. I was incharge of designing the landing page, about us, and userlanding page. We decided that we wanted the navagation bar at the top to be different from a non user and a user. I designed the landing page to give a new user to the site the most information they needed to be intrested in making an account. The about page gave highlights about the site and a little more inforamtion out our site. The userlanding page was designed for the user to click a button to all the functionality to the site. Also, it would display the users upcoming events they created. To create these mockup pages, I used an app called Procreate to add images and design it as closly as how we wanted those pages to look like. I've learned that working in a group with different design styles can be tough at first but there is always a happy medium in the end.

<h2> Future in Web Design? </h2> 

Web design has always sparked my intrest and I was very excited to implement my ideas into an acutal website.
