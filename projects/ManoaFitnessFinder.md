<h2> Freshman Fifteen </h2>

 The term "Freshman 15" is an expression commonly used in the college community that refers to an amount of weight gained during a student's first year at college. Students who are affected by the freshman 15 might feel insecure to go to the gym alone and thus gain more weight throughout college. The website my team developed allows students to create a profile with thier fitness intrest/goals, meet new people, and create or attend events.
