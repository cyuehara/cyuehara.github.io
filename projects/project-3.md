summary: A Graphical User Interface (GUI) I created for my ICS 211 final Project.

A GUI (Graphical User Interface) is a interactive visual system that allows the user to interact with the program. I created a Pokemon GUI for my final project in ICS 211. We combined all our assignments from the semester and created a game like program where we could hunt for pokemon and catch them and save the Pokemon to our pokedex. 

<img class="ui medium left floated rounded image" src="../images/PokeGui3.JPG">

The user would click the hunt button and a Pokemon along with its' information would appear to the screen. If the user clicks the catch button, the program randomly selects if the pokemon should be caught or if it escaped. If the pokemon was caught, then the user could click the backpack icon or the pokedex icon to see which and how many pokemon they achieved.
