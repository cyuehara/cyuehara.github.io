 In 2013 there were only two subdivisions teams in the robotics program, build and program. Our advisor felt that our program needed a business team for students who are interested in robotics but do not want to be on the build or program team. By 2014 the business team was created and I was assigned the lead position since I was in charge of writing the grant letters to different companies and organizing fundraising dates for the team. The business team consisted of four members who would help me put together the engineering design notebooks that we would submit at competitions. At the competition, we would take charge of collaborating with other teams and judges while the drive team prepares for the matches.

 One of the biggest competitons held annually in Hawaii is the First Robotics Competition (FRC). The business team is in charge of putting together brochures about the team and creating a display board with information about the robot. This was useful when teams and judges would walk past the pits and stop to look at what our team can do on the field. 

In my senior year I was given the opportunity to talk on Hawaii Public Radio station about our robotics team winning the 2015 State Championship  This was a crazy experience to have my last year on the team. I don't think I would have been given this opportunity if it was not for the business team working hard to promote our program.
